# Introduction

## What Is The Instruction Pipeline for PHP?

Ganbaro Digital's _The Instruction Pipeline for PHP_ gives you a way to assemble and execute commands from smaller, easy-to-reuse instructions. It's an incredibly lightweight approach to middleware.

## Goals

The goals of this library are:

* reduce how long it takes to create complex commands
* high performance (suitable for low-latency API services)

## Design Constraints

The library's design is guided by the following constraint(s):

* generic - have to be able to express any instruction pipeline

We want this library to be the mortar that helps us assemble end-user functionality as quickly as possible.
